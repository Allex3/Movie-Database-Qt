# Movie-Database-Qt
A dynamic movie database using modelview-architecture in C++ with the Qt framework for my OOP Assignments in Semester 2 of my bachelor's, storing entities in a text file

Can be viewed using HTML or CSV with libreoffice too! Admin mode is adding entities in the database, User mode is adding them to a watch list.
